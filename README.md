# 7D2D-CommunitySoundPacks
For the game 7 Days to Die. To hold a collection of community curated sound mods

Note: This is still *very* early in development and documentation has not been flushed out yet on how to use/contribute/develop packs. THERE ARE NO PACKS YET! Please stay tuned while this gets feshed out a bit more.

For now:
- *Very light* updates/discussion are likely to be occurring here in this forum thread: https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets
There are some other threads, but for now this is a place to ask questions/to get ahold of me about this project.

- In lieu of "how to add/create sounds, or submit contributions to these yet-to-be-released packs", here are some older tutorials/discussions on adding custom sounds to the game, just for information.  Its possible you will have to Update Unity to the version the game is expecting for sound imports to work.
