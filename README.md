# 7D2D-CommunitySoundPacks
For the game 7 Days to Die. To hold a collection of community curated sound mods

Note: This is still *very* early in development and documentation has not been flushed out yet on how to use/contribute/develop packs. Please stay tuned.

For now:
- *Very light* updates/discussion are likely to be occurring here in this forum thread: https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets

- In lieu of "how to add/greate sounds, or submit contributions to thiese packs, here are some older tutorials/discussions on adding custom sounds to the game:
